# Fixer

Fixer is an open-source, simple, and lightweight API for current and historical foreign exchange (forex) rates published by the European Central Bank.

The API updates rates daily around 4PM CET every working day.
 
Historical rates go back to 1st January, 1999.

I developed a mobile app using this API.

Rates are set for 32 European countries.

Quote against a different currency by setting the base parameter in your request.
